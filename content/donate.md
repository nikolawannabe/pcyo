## Why donate to the Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra?

Thank you for considering donating to the Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra.

The Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra is operated and funded by the [Sequim Community Orchestra](https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org). It is a part of the [SCO's mission](https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org/aboutUs.php) to provide educational and performance opportunities for musicians of all ages.

Originally formed in 2012 as the SCO Kids program, the SCO Board has always worked diligently to keep tuition for students low and to provide as many scholarships as needed so that no child is kept from the program due to inability to pay.  

Nearly 80% of the cost of the Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra for any given year is instructional cost.  The rest of the budget goes primarily to insurance, instrument storage, instrument repair, and classroom supplies.  We intentionally operate with a tight budget to make the students' tuition and any donor funds stretch as far as possible.
 
As of 2025, for the last several years, the children's program tuition typically only covers 20-40% of the regular annual operating costs of the program. The remainder of annual operating costs is typically covered by generous donations from the community, including the Sequim Community Orchestra members themselves, who voted to increase their dues to keep the costs of tuition for children as low as possible.
