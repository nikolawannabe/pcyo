	    Children entering our <a href="/classes/6-plus-classes">6+ string classes</a> should be able to read,
      as we begin teaching reading music in these classes right away.  These classes
      are appropriate for students who are ready to sit for about 30-45 minutes and
      learn from a teacher.  No musical background is expected.

    How does our program fit in with other Peninsula music programs?
  </h1>

  <div class="measure lh-copy">
    <p class="mb3">
      The Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra is designed to serve students who have
      traditionally had fewer opportunities to learn string instruments.
      The
      <a href="https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org/aboutUs.php"
         class="link blue hover-dark-blue">
        Sequim Community Orchestra's mission
      </a>
      specifically calls out the Sequim area, as its school district does not have an
      orchestra program. We also see many students join our classes from Chimacum.
      In Port Angeles, the school orchestra program begins in fourth grade, so students
      younger than grade 4 do not have a group program they can participate in.
      Homeschool students may also lack access to a group orchestra program.
    </p>

    <p class="mb3">
      We assume that students will graduate from our program after a few years and
      enter another orchestra suited to their skill level, such as the
      <a href="https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org/"
         class="link blue hover-dark-blue">
        Sequim Community Orchestra
      </a>.
      Once students have mastered their instrument, they may choose to audition for the
      <a href="https://portangelessymphony.org/"
         class="link blue hover-dark-blue">
        Port Angeles Symphony Orchestra
      </a>.
      This typically does not occur until high school and generally requires private
      instruction.
    </p>

    <p class="mb3">
      PCYO highly recommends private lessons in addition to our classes, especially as
      students demonstrate continued interest in their studies. Violins, violas, cellos,
      and basses are challenging instruments that take many years to master. A private
      teacher can help identify weaknesses, strengthen skills, and build on students’
      natural strengths. Please talk to your PCYO teacher for recommendations; both Port
      Angeles and Sequim have a strong community of well-vetted private instructors that
      we are happy to refer students to.
    </p>

    <p class="mb3">
      SCO and PCYO collaborate with
      <a href="https://www.olympicstringsworkshop.org/"
         class="link blue hover-dark-blue">
        Olympic Strings
      </a>,
      as our educational missions are closely aligned. Olympic Strings provides summer
      string programs for students on the Olympic Peninsula, and we highly recommend
      their offerings as a complement to our programs when classes are not in session.
    </p>

    <p class="mb3">
      The musical environment of the Olympic Peninsula is vibrant and growing, with
      several organizations actively expanding after-school opportunities for string
      students across the region. Expect more information on new and expanded
      opportunities for string students in the near future.
