# Need More Music?

If you are playing with your high school orchestra at school already, but you would like to play more and connect with students from across the Peninsula as well as adults, check out the Sequim Community Orchestra.

- Our rehearsals are consistent: once a week on Tuesdays.
- We play 3 concerts a year, always on Saturdays.
- We focus on finding the fun in playing together. Many of our members have been playing for decades. We do it because we love it.
- We welcome students playing at a high school level from anywhere across the Peninsula.

Fall rehearsals in 2025 start September 16th. Rehearsals are 7-9pm at Swisher Hall in Carrie Blake Park in Sequim (next to the band shell). 

Concert dates are:
- November 15, 2025 7pm
- February 14, 2026 2pm Family Concert with Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra
- May 9, 2026 7pm

The Sequim Community Orchestra is a dues supported program ($20/mo or $150/yr).
