Does your student play an instrument with their school program already? If they are thinking about switching, or have already switched to a new instrument but need practice on their new clef, Winter Term with the PCYO is a great time to try it!  Our beginner class will have gotten past the "what's a bow" stage and be into the "let's learn this clef" stage so it's a great time for students who know how to play an instrument but need support on a new one to join us.

The PCYO maintains an instrument library of violins, violas, cellos and basses available to loan to most students who would like to try a switch.  

We currently have limited slots available in Winter Term in both Port Angeles and Sequim.

Winter Term runs from January 6th to March 5th, and runs Mondays and Wednesdays.  Students enrolling as a switch-up student may elect to only attend one session.  Tuition is $150 per term.
