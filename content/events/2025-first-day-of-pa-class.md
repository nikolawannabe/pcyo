Our first day of class in Port Angeles is almost here! 

Meet at First United Methodist Church on 7th Street in Port Angeles. 

Parents should plan to attend the first class with their child as there
will be paper work to attend to.

Contact registrar@sequimcommunityorchestra.org with any questions, and see
[Current students](/current-students) for additional information about 
classes.

The Port Angeles class has ONE spot left and you may sign up
on [Jovial](https://jovial.org/pcyo/hello).
