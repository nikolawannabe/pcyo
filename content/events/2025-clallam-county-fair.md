Come see us at the Clallam County Fair for kids day, on August 14, 2025.

We will be at our booth from 9am to 9pm. Come by to talk to our volunteers,
board members, or other parents.  

For children first grade and up, we will be conducting instrument fittings
and offering a photo booth with their fitted instrument.  Digital photos
of your child are free; donation requested for a physical copy we'll print
on site.
