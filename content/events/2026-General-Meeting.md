We plan to hold an information gathering meeting **February 15 at 2pm** to discuss the upcoming 2026-2027 year of classes and events, and other items of interest to the youth orchestra.

**Date**: February 15th

**Time**: 2pm

**Location**: Swisher Hall in Carrie Blake Park in Sequim, WA

A draft agenda is available for [review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xZq766fBoNfcpBPduTD4MLx57C1P3omS/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107459316929255460073&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Anyone interested in helping provide feedback, guide the program, teach students, or take on a leadership role is encouraged to attend.


This meeting is for informational purposes only \-- we will not make decisions or schedule classes directly, but we'd like to gather feedback from parents, potential parents, teachers, and interested community members on our upcoming Fall programming which we would like to be ready to announce in March.

An online meeting via Google Meet will also be available for those who wish to attend that way.

**Scheduling and Program Planning Surveys:**  
Parents or students who would like to let us know of their preferences on times and locations and or intent to participate in Fall 2026, they may do so by filling out any relevant surveys below prior to Feb 15:

* [Sprouts 0-6](https://forms.gle/iknx8FnMgvTrTLs67) (by default we will probably change the time of some of these a bit to get Christine a better schedule)  
* [Beginner and Intermediates 6+](https://forms.gle/BPgkzTLnbomfNTrn6) (by default the times will stay the same but the location of the beginners in Sequim will change to Trinity to accommodate the youth orchestra.  We will add an intermediate class in PA after the beginner class in Fall 2026.)  
* [Youth Orchestra](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWR01CHOFgiFg4tV6uYlqBL34nepqak5asH_pimQraWYWqkQ/viewform): Parents of students 6+ having completed minimally 1-3 year of classes or lessons by Fall 2026 (intermediate and advanced students) who are not ready for the SCO.  Best for students with 2+ years with us, or 1 year plus private lessons. May not be compatible with Intermediates PA class schedule-wise. Most likely will be compatible with Sequim Intermediates class.  This group is not a general studies group teaching violin, viola, cello, bass, but is instead aimed at providing extra repertoire, experience in larger groups, and practice at staying with your section instead of the whole class.  
* [Winter & Spring](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/100Vp8Ptp0_L14_C-KMDW66BZYesJmOXSOZap9gGZZH0/edit#responses) 2026 Adult Strings for Beginners (There will be an additional survey for Fall 2026 once Winter term is further along.)
