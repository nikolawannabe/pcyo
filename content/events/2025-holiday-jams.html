		This December, the Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra has organized a
collection of short holiday family jams held across Clallam County taught by local

musicians and private teachers playing easy beginner and intermediate holiday
music. Each holiday jam will welcome up to 5 students, and coaches will invite
students playing instruments they are personally familiar with, allowing family and
friends to play along with beginner and intermediate string students on guitar,
piano, or wind instruments as able. Any students of the appropriate age playing
the appropriate instruments may sign up!
	</p>
	<h3 class="tc">Individual jams listed below to select from.  Many dates and locations!</h3>
	<p class="tc">
		You are also invited to join us for cocoa and a shared celebration of holiday music with
		some of our children's groups who would like to share their work on
		December 17th at 5pm at Field Hall in Port Angeles! Many of our coaches will also be there to chat and
		share some holiday music of their own. 
	</p>
	<p>
		At 7pm, Field Hall will be hosting renowned stage actor Allen Fitzpatrick as he presents his solo adaptation of Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol.”
