Our first day of class in Sequim is almost here! 

If you have not already measured your student and sent in measurements, or
seen the registrar to have them measured, please do so so that we can
seek an appropriate instrument for them.  We may not have instruments for
all sizes and children and knowing in advance helps to ensure your student
can receive their instrument in the first week of class.

Contact registrar@sequimcommunityorchestra.org for details, and see
[Current students](/current-students) for additional information about 
classes.

Please note the Sequim class is FULL!

The Port Angeles class in now open for registration and you may sign up
on [Jovial](https://jovial.org/pcyo/hello).  The Port Angeles class will
start a few weeks later than our Sequim class this year, most likely
on October 6th.
