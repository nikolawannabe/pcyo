    Christine has 30 years of experience teaching Suzuki classes and private lessons,
    and directing youth orchestras from New York and Texas. She has recently returned
    to her roots in Washington. We are so grateful to have her traveling from Port
    Orchard to Sequim and Port Angeles to offer early music education for our 
    youngest students.
    Suzuki group classes have not been available in Port Angeles for decades. Christine
    also offers private lessons to 3–6 year old students, which pair perfectly with
    her Suzuki Sprouts classes and are in extremely short supply in Port Angeles.

      <h5>Friday at 3:30-4:20 -- Trinity United Methodist Church in Sequim</h5>
      <p>This 50-minute weekly class blends rhythm, song, and playful movement to build the
coordination, listening, and focus skills that form the foundation for violin study. Young children
sing, tap, move, and explore music through scarves, rhythm instruments, and song stories in a
warm, structured setting.</p>
      <p>Designed for ages 3–6, the class develops timing, motor control, and musical awareness through
familiar songs like Frog in the Meadow and Lightly Row, as well as classical favorites such as
Fingal’s Cave and selections from standard Suzuki repertoire. Each session follows a consistent
format that balances predictability with discovery - helping children feel confident, attentive, and
excited about learning.</p>
      <p>Tuition is $150 per term, with $50 due at registration and the remainder due 1 week before
      class starts.</p>

	   <p>Peninsula Community Sound Sprouts brings real music—classical, folk, and traditional
songs—into children’s lives through play, movement, and family connection. Designed for
children from infancy through early childhood, Sound Sprouts helps develop listening, rhythm,
coordination, and connection with others while nurturing a lifelong appreciation for great music.</p>

body, mind, and spirit - through active listening, singing in tune, and keeping a steady beat.</p>
	   <p>Parents participate alongside their children, gaining simple tools to make music part of daily life.
	   No musical background is required - just a willingness to sing, move, and connect.</p>
	   <p>Peninsula Community Sound Sprouts is not entertainment; it’s education made joyful - an
	   invitation to grow together through real music, naturally.</p>
	   <p>Tuition is $150 per term, with $50 due at registration and the remainder due 1 week before
      class starts.</p>
