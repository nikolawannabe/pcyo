      <li>Currently we offer <strong>Beginner string classes for 6+ students</strong> in Port Angeles
            and Sequim, and <strong>Intermediate classes for 6+ students</strong> in Sequim.  We
            plan to add an intermediate class for students with 1 year of our classes in Fall of 2026
            which our beginner students will graduate into, and students in public schools with
            1+ year of school classes or private lessons may join to get extra practice.
    </li>
    <li>
	    We hope to offer a one day per week evening youth orchestra for middle school students in Fall 2026.
	    It is currently planned to run 4:30-5:45pm Mondays at Swisher Hall in 
	    Sequim in Carrie Blake Park.
    </li>
    <li>
            Our 6+ string classes are progressive throughout the year, so students wishing to
            start with no musical background should plan to join in fall.       Students switching instruments or students who need 
	    extra help on their instrument from private lessons or school classes may join the beginner class mid-year or mid-term
      if there is room. Otherwise, students should plan to start in the Fall and continue
      with regular attendance through May to progress with their class and graduate into the intermediate class.
