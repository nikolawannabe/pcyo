# How does our program fit in with other Peninsula music programs?

The Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra is designed to serve students that have traditionally
had less opportunities to learn string instruments.  The [Sequim Community Orchestra's mission](https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org/aboutUs.php)
specifically calls out the Sequim area as it's school district does not have an orchestra
program.  We also see many students join our classes from Chimacum. In Port Angeles, the 
school orchestra program begins in fourth grade, so students in grades 1-3 do not have a 
group program they can participate in.  Homeschool students also may lack a program that they can participate in.

We assume that students will graduate from our program after a few years, and enter another
orchestra that their skills are suited to, such as the Sequim Community Orchestra.  Once
students have mastered their instrument, they may choose to audition for the Port Angeles
Symphony Orchestra.  This does not typically occur until high school, and generally requires
a private teacher.

The SCO and PCYO collaborate with [Olympic Strings](https://www.olympicstringsworkshop.org/) as our educational mission is very closely aligned with theirs. Olympic Strings
provide summer string programs for students on the Olympic Peninsula and we highly recommend
their programs as additions to ours when our classes are not in session.

The musical environment of the Olympic Peninsula is very vibrant and lively and several groups
are actively engaged in expanding the after school experience for students across the Peninsula.  Expect more information on expansions of opportunities for string students soon.
