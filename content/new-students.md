## About Our Teacher
### Sara Baldwin
Sara has 25 years of experience as a public school orchestra director, and over 30 years
as a studio teacher for violin, viola, cello, and music theory.

## About Our Classes
- Peninsula Community Youth Orchestra is for children in grades 2-12.  Children entering the program should be able to read.  More advanced high school students may instead prefer to join our parent organization, the [Sequim Community Orchestra](https://sequimcommunityorchestra.org).
- We offer group lessons for beginner, intermediate, and advanced learners of violin, viola, cello, or bass.  
- Classes are held Monday and Wednesday afternoons.
- Classes are located at Swisher Hall in Sequim, WA, which is near Carrie Blake Park and the soccer fields.
- Tuition is $100 per trimester, or $300 per year. Discounts are available for families with
multiple students.
- Scholarships are available on request.

Registration will open soon.
